Train a VAE model (1) use BERT-based embeddings to convert target texts into vectors (different bert-based models can be selected based on research needs.) (2) only use the latent vectors (50 dimensions) for classification (caputure essence, for example, to capture text styles independent of contents.)
Use a decision tree model to classify the latent vectors;
Use the tree model's GINI Importance to identify the important dimensions that contribute to 95% confidence.
Conduct pertubation tests on the identified important dimensions to further confirm the determinate (most important) dimensions. (1) change values of the dimensions from -2 to 2 for the pertubation; (2) while the confidence of the tree model to make decisions remains the same, the dimensions that after the pertubation tests causes a change in classification decisions are selected for further analysis.
The excel file displays the pertubation test result, as a case study to distinguishe interpreted from non-interpreted speeches.
